<p>
The Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Lab (HCAIL) is a research group in
the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Seoul (UOS).
Our research interests lie at the intersection of multiple domains:
<b>
human-centered AI,
health informatics,
social computing,
and accessibility</b>.
<!-- decision-making,
health informatics,
human-computer interaction, data visualization,
and social computing.
-->
Our research aimed to support individuals
with special needs (e.g., older adults with diabetes, vloggers and streamers with visual
impairments, North Korean defectors with depression, Timebank members) through
design and engineering across multiple domains: health, social media,
sharing economy, and education but not limited to those areas.</p>
<p>We are pursing research in the combinations of the following directions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Artificial Intelligence</p>
</li>
<li><p>Health Informatics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Human-Computer Interaction</p>
</li>
</ul>
